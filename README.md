# ART.API
This is the backend application for ART(Andela Resource Tracker)

Our goal is to create a mobile application that will streamline the check in and checkout process at the Andela premises and have this data stored safely where it is not susceptible to damage or compromisation.

The API is used to:

Add,Edit,Delete,Search assets by the Ops department using the react Dashboard from the `Asset database`
Posting checkin data to the `checkin database`
Posting Checkout data to the `checkout database`
